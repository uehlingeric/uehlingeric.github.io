            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
              My name is Eric, and I am a student currently pursuing two degrees in Economics 
              and Computer Science at Virginia Tech. I am passionate about exploring the intersection
              of technology and business and how it can be leveraged to create innovative solutions 
              to complex problems. I am excited to share that I have secured an internship with AECOM,
              a global engineering and infrastructure firm, for the upcoming summer. I will be working
              with their data science team to develop software solutions that will enhance the company's
              operations and improve its overall efficiency. After graduation, I hope to pursue a
              career that allows me to utilize my skills in both economics and computer science to
              tackle real-world problems and create positive change. I am excited about the opportunities
              that lie ahead and am committed to continuous learning and growth in my field.
